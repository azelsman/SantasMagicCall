        <p><em>Last updated: December 1, 2025</em></p>

        <p>
            Santa’s Magic Call (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) is committed to ensuring that 
            our website, orientation videos, and Santa call experience are accessible to all families, including people with disabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to meet the <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA</strong>, which outline how to make digital
            services accessible and user-friendly for individuals of varying abilities.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What We’ve Done</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured pages using semantic HTML for better screen-reader compatibility.</li>
            <li>Added clear labels, descriptive alt text, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.</li>
            <li>Ensured navigation is possible with a keyboard, including video controls and modal dialogs.</li>
            <li>Provided accessible color contrast and scalable text throughout the site.</li>
            <li>Designed the Santa call experience to be <strong>audio-only</strong>, reducing visual accessibility barriers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Ongoing Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Accessibility is an ongoing effort. We regularly test our site using assistive technologies, review new features
            for compliance, and make improvements based on user feedback.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Components</h2>
        <p>
            Our service uses a small number of third-party tools (such as video hosting, audio rendering, or payment processors).
            These providers may not fully meet WCAG standards. Although we do not control these platforms, we select partners
            committed to accessibility and will assist users wherever possible.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Need Help or Want to Report a Barrier?</h2>
        <p>
            If you experience difficulty accessing any part of Santa’s Magic Call or encounter a feature that does not function
            properly with assistive technology, please let us know so we can fix it.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
            If you believe your accessibility rights are not being upheld, you may file a complaint with your local regulatory agency.  
            However, we encourage you to reach out to us first — we’re committed to resolving issues quickly and thoughtfully.
