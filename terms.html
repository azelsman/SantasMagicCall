        <p>
            Welcome to Santa’s Magic Call (“<strong>Santa’s Magic Call</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). 
            These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) apply when you purchase, access, or use our website, 
            videos, orientation materials, and the live Santa voice-call experience (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).
        </p>

        <p>
            By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>1. What Santa’s Magic Call Is</h2>
        <p>
            Santa’s Magic Call is an on-demand, pre-paid digital experience. Each purchase includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A private link for <strong>one live 5-minute voice call with Santa</strong> (available Dec 7–24).</li>
            <li>A short <strong>Elf Orientation</strong> video to warm your child up before the call.</li>
            <li>A <strong>follow-up Santa video</strong> emailed afterward.</li>
            <li>Optional <strong>Christmas Magic Messages</strong> emailed before Christmas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The call is a <strong>voice-only</strong> digital character experience. It is not a phone call or video chat.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Who May Use the Service</h2>
        <p>
            You may use the Service only if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are <strong>18 or older</strong>, and</li>
            <li>You are the <strong>parent or legal guardian</strong> of the child participating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Children must be supervised. The Service is not intended for children to access independently.
        </p>

        <h2>3. No Collection of Children’s Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            The Santa experience is intentionally designed to <strong>avoid collecting personal information from children</strong>.
            We do <strong>not</strong> request:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Children’s names</li>
            <li>Addresses</li>
            <li>Photos or videos</li>
            <li>Demographic or identifying details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not sell or share children’s information and follow COPPA-aligned design principles.
            (See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.)
        </p>

        <h2>4. How the Live Santa Call Works</h2>
        <p>
            Your purchase provides access to a <strong>single-use</strong>, <strong>5-minute</strong>, 
            <strong>voice-only</strong> Santa call that works between <strong>Dec 7–24</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The call ends automatically when the session expires and cannot be extended, transferred, or reused.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not record or store audio</strong> from the call. We may retain 
            <strong>AI-generated conversation transcripts</strong> for safety, quality, and system improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payments, Refunds & “We’ll Make It Right”</h2>
        <p>
            Payments are processed through secure third-party providers (e.g., Stripe). 
            We never see or store your full payment details.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a technical issue prevents the call from working as described, we will 
            <strong>make it right</strong> by offering a replacement call or a refund at our discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Refunds cannot be issued for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expired or unused call links (after Dec 24)</li>
            <li>Device, speaker, or internet issues outside our control</li>
            <li>Scheduling conflicts or missed calls</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>No collection of identifying details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may interrupt or end a call if unsafe topics arise.  
            The Service provides <strong>imaginative entertainment only</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            All characters, voices, stories, videos, graphics, orientation materials, and website content
            are owned by Santa’s Magic Call. You may not copy, distribute, reproduce, or reverse engineer
            any part of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if we detect misuse or violations of these Terms.  
            You may stop using the Service at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to conflict of law principles.  
            You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in North Carolina.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated version here with a new
